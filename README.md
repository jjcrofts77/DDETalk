# Reveal.js presentation
## Example of using Reveal.js and Mathjax to create slide presentations with LaTeX
The Beamer LaTeX package is great for making technical presentations but is limited to PDF output, making it difficult 
to display videos. Powerpoint and Keynote allow embedded videos, but mathematical expressions must be laboriously 
generated (e.g., using LaTeXit), one expression at a time and placed within the presentation by hand. Moreover, style 
changes cannot be made without redoing every equation, making it difficult to recombine slides from different 
presentations.

Reveal.js is a package, much like Beamer. It uses a markup language and LateX to make slide presentations. However, Reveal.js 
displays slides in a web browser rather than a PDF, allowing a wide range of multimedia content, including videos and powerful 
animations.
### Features include
  1. Intelligently autoplay videos
  2. Type equations and math (inline and display) using LaTeX
  3. Easily change the style of your text (including LaTeX!) using CSS
  4. Display anything that can be viewed in a webpage (images, videos, youtube, PDF, SVG, SVG animations, etc)
  5. Real-time animations using JavaScript (Think Matlab, but embedded into every modern web browser)
  6. Play your presentations on any device that can run a modern web browser
  7. Publish your presentations on your webserver
